# Meli

## What is it?

An example of an [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron)-based application
that is per se a menubar icon dropdown for note taking. If you're like me and
like having a place to quickly unload a sudden idea, but hate having
stickies-like app constantly on the desktop, this one may come in handy.

## Why Meli?

An acronym from menu list, incredibly creative, I know.

## Installation

Clone the repository, `npm i`. `npm run pack` created a packaged application
for your system.

## Usage

Run, click on the listy icon in the menubar, write some stuff in the textarea.
Your stuff gets saved in `~/.meli` and gets loaded automatically next time you
open the app. Right click on the menubar icon to exit.
